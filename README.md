## Problem Statement
An education company needs help for selecting the most promising leads, which are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company has requested to build a model in which you assign a score to the customer/leads in order to determine the customers with higher lead score that can help understand the chances of conversion. The CEO has instructed to identify the conversion rate to be around 80% for the lead targets.

## Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study.

- Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
- There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.

## Steps involved in solving the problem
1. Importing the libraries
2. Loading and reading the data
3. Understanding and cleaning the data
4. Performing EDA - Univariate and Bivariate analysis
5. Preparing data for modelling
6. Model Building
7. Evaluation of the Final Model
8. Checking other accuracies beyond simple accuracy
9. Plotting the ROc curve
10. Finding the otimal cutoff and calculating precision and recall
11. Making the prediction on test set
12. Conclussion
